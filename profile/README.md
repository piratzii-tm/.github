## ðŸ“š About 
>We are a group of programmers who joined forces by competing in different algorithm contests and hackathons. Our goal is to grow and spread our love for programming and light the path of those who can't seem to know where to go.

>We encourage everyone to join us and help us reach our goal and why not, have some fun?

## ðŸš€ Our Activities

> Alongside our love for participating in different contests we like to bring our own touch to the competitive programming world, so we are doing all sorts of activities with our community. These activities include hackathons and daily algo problems. The hackathons are listed below and the daily algo problems can be found on our discord server.
